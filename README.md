if you want to use this code you need 1 car(2 or 4 wheel) and a esp32 

in this code I will use the arrow/joystick to move like normal but if you want to go straight(all motor go straight when using the joystick mode) you can use the triangle for go straight, square turn left, circle turn right, and cross for go backward
